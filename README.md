# cmp-nvim-lsp

nvim-cmp source for neovim's built-in language server client.

## Capabilities

Language servers provide different completion results depending on the capabilities of the client. Neovim's default omnifunc has basic support for serving completion candidates. nvim-cmp supports more types of completion candidates, so users must override the capabilities sent to the server such that it can provide these candidates during a completion request. These capabilities are provided via the helper function `require('cmp_nvim_lsp').default_capabilities`

As these candidates are sent on each request, **adding these capabilities will break the built-in omnifunc support for neovim's language server client**. `nvim-cmp` provides manually triggered completion that can replace omnifunc. See `:help cmp-faq` for more details.

## Setup

```lua

require'cmp'.setup {
  sources = {
    { name = 'nvim_lsp' }
  }
}

-- Merge default LSP cabilities with what is supported by nvim-cmp
local capabilities = vim.tbl_deep_extend("force",
  vim.lsp.protocol.make_client_capabilities(),
  require('cmp_nvim_lsp').default_capabilities()
)

-- An example for configuring `clangd` LSP to use nvim-cmp as a completion engine
require('lspconfig').clangd.setup {
  capabilities = capabilities,
  ...  -- other lspconfig configs
}
```

## Option

`[%LSPCONFIG-NAME%].keyword_pattern`

You can override keyword_pattern for specific language-server like this.

```lua
cmp.setup {
  ...
  sources = {
    {
      name = 'nvim_lsp',
      option = {
        php = {
          keyword_pattern = [=[[\%(\$\k*\)\|\k\+]]=],
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ...
}
```
